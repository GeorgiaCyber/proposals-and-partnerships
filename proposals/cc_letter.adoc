== Executive Summary

The National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C) has issued a solicitation calling for proposals related to "Cybersecurity Community Development", specifically in the area of critical infrastructure security.
Augusta University and the Georgia Cyber Center desire a partnership with Columbia County on this effort in order to demonstrate and cement the reputation of the local community as a critical infrastructure security research hub.

The grant application would call for the first-of-its-kind external review of county critical infrastructure, subsequently (in accordance with pre-negotiated non-disclosure agreements) the results would be published.
The goal would be to set a precedent for recurring research and increasingly public results, similar to ISAC.

Columbia County's anticipated contribution would be in the form of access:

. Access to critical infrastructure staff
. Access to critical infrastructure itself (either in production or test kit)
. Access to original operational technology hardware manufacturers and vendors

Given the short suspense, the short-term contribution would be a letter signed by the Chairman (or at whatever level is appropriate) committing to the same, the likeness of which would be included in the grant proposal.

The proposal is due to NCAE on the 12th of April, 2021.

== Personnel

The Georgia Cyber Center will be responsible for identifying qualified and trustworthy security researchers who will examine the various pieces of critical infrastructure.
Columbia County will be responsible for providing these researchers access to the information technology and other personnel who manage, operate, and maintain these systems.
These personnel will be critical in giving the researchers and full understand of system design and operational procedures so they may best focus their technical efforts for maximum return.

== Equipment

All equipment involved in the grant would be provided by Columbia County.
The county would supervise security researchers as they conducted their work, particularly on systems that are considered 'in production'.
The goal would be to give the researchers as much access as possible, while also ensuring continuity of operations.

== Vendors

Most importantly, Columbia County needs to facilitate communications between the researchers and the vendors.
Manufacturers in this space are notoriously cagey and are usually unwilling to support external security research.
The leveraging of the relationship between Columbia County and their critical infrastructure manufacturers will be extremely important - security research is significantly more difficult when researchers have an adversarial relationship with vendors.
Columbia County will be critical in convincing vendors that this grant effort is a partnership designed to make vendor systems more resilient to the benefit of their shareholders rather than a way to showcase software and hardware shortcomings.
