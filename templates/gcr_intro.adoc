The platform is built entirely from open-source components via the https://github.com/GeorgiaCyber/kinetic[kinetic framework] with the intent of providing an environment that can be replecated with local hardware at no cost.
The Georgia Cyber Range is designed to go far beyond capturing traditional enterprise IT cybersecurity topics and provide a platform for conducting advanced research into and training with:

* alternate CPU architectures (arm, SPARC, MIPS, ppc, risc-v, etc.)
* legacy technology
* operational technology (industrial control systems, SCADA, etc.)
* embedded systems
* and more
