The Georgia Cyber Range is a computing environment hosted at the Georgia Cyber Center providing a platform for education, training, research, demonstrations, development and more.

The platform is built entirely from open-source components via the https://github.com/GeorgiaCyber/kinetic[kinetic framework] with the intent of providing an environment that is completely reproducible on local hardware at no cost, if such a need arose.
The Georgia Cyber Range is designed to enable going far beyond capturing traditional enterprise IT cybersecurity topics and provide a platform for conducting advanced research into and training with:

* alternate CPU architectures (arm, SPARC, MIPS, ppc, risc-v, etc.)
* legacy technology
* operational technology (industrial control systems, SCADA, etc.)
* embedded systems
* and more
