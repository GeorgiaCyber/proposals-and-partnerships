One of the great ironies in systems security is the fact that the most critical components that make day-to-day life possible across the world are also some of the most poorly designed and defended.

This is due to a myriad of reasons, but can generally be boiled down to:

* Vendors must provide functionality first to stay in business and security comes as an afterthought, if considered at all
* Manufacturers and developers do not invest time in trying to understand what new tools, techniques, and research results are available that can contribute to the security posture of their systems
* Lack of available technical personnel with required skillsets, exacerbated by an incredibly high barrier to entry for new personnel looking to become experts in this space
* Unwillingness of vendors and manufacturers to provide systems insight due to fear of bad publicity
* General lack of urgency due to incorrect perception that high-profile 'hacks' (Sony, Atlanta, Equifax) that drive news cycles are more deserving of attention than critical infrastructure issues

The reality is that while the 'hacks' that can be read about in the news are unfortunate,
they are generally fiscal inconveniences for the affected rather than life-or-death events.
The Georgia Cyber Center seeks to make critical infrastructure a first-class citizen in the realm of cyber security and to help ensure that we never have to find out what happens when a determined adversary launches a serious attack against global infrastructure.
