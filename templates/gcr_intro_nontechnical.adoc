The Georgia Cyber Range is a computing environment hosted at the Georgia Cyber Center.
It is meant to provide a platform for education, training, research, demonstrations, development and more.
The platform is built entirely from open-source components and is designed to enable going far beyond capturing traditional enterprise IT cybersecurity topics and delve deeply into the world of operational technology.

Operational technology can be considered to be all computing systems that are not part of the traditional enterprise computing environment such as desktops, laptops, and items hosted in datacenters.
Instead, operational technology encompasses the systems that make daily life possible such as the control systems in use at power plants, airports, refineries, seaports, factories, civil engineering projects, and more.
By focusing on operational technology cybersecurity instead of the oversaturated field of information technology cybersecurity, the Georgia Cyber Range offers a unique set of capabilities that are not readily available anywhere else.
